### About the Visualization
Crawling the Chain is an interactive network dashboard designed to provide a comprehensive and easily accessible overview of the diverse and rapidly evolving world of blockchain technology. Our visualization aims to empower users to better understand the various blockchain platforms, niches, and applications, enabling them to make informed decisions and navigate this complex landscape with greater ease. The data was pulled from DeFi Llama API and graphed with D3.

### Goals

To offer a clear, organized, and visually appealing representation of the different blockchain platforms (e.g., Avalanche, Polygon, Ethereum, Arbitrum, BCC), their niches (e.g., yield, cross-chain, credit/lending, reserve currency, DEXes), and their applications (e.g., Stargate, Uniswap, Aave, SushiSwap).
To enable users to quickly grasp the scale and significance of each platform, niche, and application based on their Total Value Locked (TVL) through the use of appropriately sized circles.
To facilitate the comparison and analysis of platforms, niches, and applications, allowing users to better evaluate the blockchain ecosystem as a whole.
To keep users informed about the latest developments and trends in the blockchain space by regularly updating the visualization based on the latest available data.

### Intended Audience

Our visualization is intended for a broad audience, including but not limited to:
Blockchain enthusiasts seeking to deepen their understanding of the diverse range of platforms, niches, and applications.
Investors who want to analyze and compare the performance of various blockchain projects based on their TVL.
Developers looking for inspiration or collaboration opportunities within the blockchain ecosystem.
Educators and researchers interested in studying the growth and evolution of the blockchain space.

### Changes from the Usability Study

Improve navigation and controls: Implement zoom in/out functionality, navigation buttons or a mini-map, and auto-adjust the distance between nodes based on the browser window size to enhance user experience.
Add a clear legend and explanations: Create a legend for color-coding and component categories, and provide brief descriptions for each component (yield, dexes, derivatives/options, cross chain) to improve user understanding.
Enhance text readability and visual differentiation: Adjust text size, spacing, and color to minimize overlap and improve readability. Consider using more contrasting colors or patterns for better differentiation between components.
Incorporate additional data and features: Display TVL values when hovering over circles or inside the circles if possible without obscuring other text, and consider adding historical trends, performance metrics, or growth indicators to inform usersâ€™ decision-making processes.
Optimize chart scaling and initial view: Ensure that the chart is centered and appropriately scaled when the page first loads, minimizing the need for scrolling or zooming to view the entire visualization.

### Explore

Blockchain by TVL: Cross filter or search by niche to view TVL breakdown by chain
MC/TVL ratio: Cross filter by niche to view apps by MC/TVL ratio

### Data Sources

The data for our visualization is primarily sourced from DeFi Llama (https://defillama.com), a reliable and widely recognized platform that tracks TVL across multiple blockchain ecosystems.
